Waking up in the morning feeling fresh and blessed
Lotta fucking things make you speak even less
I don't come with the piece, I come with a piece of advice
6 figure rings, might girl undress

Oh my
Why no one is
Talking
Oh my

Feeling so relaxed like nothing doesn't matter
Such a contrast with DMT I be on
Vibes in the club that's Afterlife
Goons are lost in the Paradise
Taking a fast ride in the city of neon
Such a contrast with DMT I be on
Playboy bunny looking pretty from Milan
Moving that body in a slo-mo, such a turn-on

Neon
Heart
There is nothing
In me
Everything is
Taken apart

8 more figures and my heart is in chrome
How you like that
Baby, I came from the Voodoo gang
Imma be at the top in the city

Damn I
Feel
DMT is hitting my head
Club is
Banging
Like there's
No tomorrow
What we feel is nothing
Everything is taken apart
