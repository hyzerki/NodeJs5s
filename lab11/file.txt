I will come back
And you'll be singing my songs
I will not know
Or at least pretend that I'm wrong

I will come back
And you'll be saying, "I'm the one"
I will let you
I always knew you'd be a star

Somethings left am I right
Someones hurt that you like
Catch your breath when you lie
Be with me until we die
Burn the house, burn the house down

I will come back
And you'll be loving me more
Love when you moan
Chills run through my bones

I will come back
We'll be higher than ever
Until the world еnds
It's always now or never

Somethings lеft am I right
Someones hurt that you like
Catch your breath when you lie
Be with me until we die

Ye ye ye ye
Won't you die with me
Me me me me
Won't you ride until we
We we we we
Burn the house down
As as as as
Sing the song as loud
